Algorithm for finding prime numbe
When the program starts, the user sees 3 windows.
In the upper right corner, the user needs to enter the number N, where N is the threshold number for the interval we need, consisting of prime numbers. After entering the number N, click on the "Press me!" button. After clicking on the button, smaller windows will appear in the left window, searching for multiples of each prime number not exceeding the square root of N. After the end of the program, all the required primes from the interval [3, N] will be displayed in the lower right window "Result".  Also all primes will be output to a text file "algo.txt "
